Bugs

I encountered a few bugs, Mostly through making the website responsive. The main issues was that the page was not tested through development and therefore at the end the project needed alot of re-working to make responsive.

This is not my main design for my website, This website was my back-up website as during development of this website I thought that It did not look good. However the New website was not compeletly responsive in time and therefore I cannot submit it,

Besides these issues there were no issues,
