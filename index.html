                <h2>Early Life:</h2>
                <p class = "text">Gaius Julius Caesar was brought into the world on July 12 or 13, 100 BCE, into an aristocrat family in Rome. His family said that the Trojan prince Aeneas, through Venus, was their ancestor. 
                    Caesar's dad, Gaius Julius Caesar, held moderate political impact, while his mom, Aurelia Cotta, came from a recognized family. In his childhood, Caesar got exhaustive schooling in way of talking, writing, and theory.
                    <br><br>
                    He showed an early interest in open life and legislative issues. At 16 years old, he lost his dad, and as the top of the family, he turned into the ward of Gaius Marius, a noticeable general and legislator, because of his family's political associations. 
                    During this time, Rome experienced political unrest, known as the Social Conflict and the contention among Marius and Sulla. Caesar explored these turbulent times, and after Sulla's triumph, he started his political profession. 
                    He rose through the positions, separating himself in different military missions, remembering for Asia Minor and Spain. Julius Caesar's initial outcome in the military, combined with his persuasive abilities, acquired him prevalence and backing from the Roman public. 
                    <br><br>
                    He was quaestor, aedile, and praetor, among other political positions. Nonetheless, it was his consulship in 59 BCE, alongside Pompey and Crassus, that undeniable a critical defining moment in Roman governmental issues, shaping the Primary Magistrate. 
                    Caesar's initial life set up for his later accomplishments and the urgent job he would play in Roman history. His aspiration, military ability, and political astuteness would ultimately push him to become perhaps of the most compelling figure in old Rome.</p>

                <h2>Julius Caesar's Rise to Power</h2>
                <p class = "text">Julius Caesar, a well-known figure in Roman history, rose to power through his tactical ability and political keenness. In 59 BCE, Caesar got his first consulship, Which was the start of his groundbreaking effect on Roman Politics. 
                    During his consulship, he shaped a union with Pompey and Crassus, known as the First Triumvirate, which allowed them to fortify their power and persue after their interests. The alliance, on the other hand, eventually broke down, triggering a power struggle in Rome.
        <br><br>
                    One of Caesar's most significant contributions to Roman history was his leadership in the Gallic Wars (58-50 BCE). He began a series of military campaigns to expand Roman territory.
                    Caesar's triumph of Gaul showed his brilliance in strategy and cemented his standing as a powerful and intelligent military leader. His Commentarii de Bello Gallico, a firsthand record of the conflicts, stays a significant verifiable source.<!--TODO: Add an Anchor Tag to the Commentarii de Bello Gallico-->
        <br><br>
                    As Caesar's power and influence grew, tensions rose between him and the Senate, which lead to a series of events that prompted the Roman Civil War (49-45 BCE). 
                    Caesar's crossing of the Rubicon river in 49 BCE marked the beginning of the conflict. The war set Caesar in opposition to the powers of the Senate, drove by Pompey, his previous ally. 
                    The Battle of Pharsalus in 48 BCE was the eventual turning point in the war, with Caesar emerging victorious and resulting in Pompey fleeing to Egypt, where he died not long after, marking a turning point in history. 
                    The Civil War at last brought about Caesar's ascent to outright power and the finish of the Roman Republic. 
                    Caesar's crossing of the Rubicon river and the resulting Civil War are significant moments that forever changed the Roman Republic and history as we know it.</p>

                <h2>The Fall of Julius Caesar and the start of the Roman Empire</h2>
                <p class = "text">The death of Julius Caesar on the Ides of Spring (Walk 15) in 44 BCE is quite possibly of the most famous event in Roman history. Caesar had gathered remarkable power, proclaimed himself as tyrant claiming that only he shall rule, and confronted developing resistance from legislators who dreaded his rising power.
                    A gathering of backstabbers, including notable figures like Cassius and Brutus, coordinated a plot to wipe out Caesar and re-establish the Roman Republic. 
                    Upon the arrival of the death, as Caesar entered the Senate meeting at the Theater of Pompey, he was encircled by the schemers who went after him with knifes. As indicated by verifiable records, even Brutus, whom Caesar thought was a close ally, was among the individuals who struck him. 
                    Caesar received the fatal blow from Brutus, and he died from his wounds with the well-known last words, "Et tu, Brute?" showing the shock of betrayal he felt.
                    <br><br>
                    The death of Julius Caesar had many consequences for the Roman Republic. Instead of re-establishing the traditional republican system, the assassination placed Rome into a time of political turmoil and civil unrest. 
                    It set the stage for a series of conflicts that in the end prompted the ascent of Caesar's grandnephew and adopted son, Octavian (later known as Augustus), and the foundation of the Roman Empire. 
                    The assassination of Julius Caesar is known as a turning point in Roman history, signalling the end of the Roman Republic and the beginning of the new Roman Empire.</p>
